Universal Ciphertext Re-encryption Protocol (UCRP) Design Document
Introduction
The Universal Ciphertext Re-encryption Protocol (UCRP) is a novel protocol for securely decrypting encrypted data without revealing the entire decryption key. This protocol is particularly useful for decrypting lost or stolen devices, as it does not require the device owner to possess the private key or seed phrase to recover their data.

Problem Statement
Traditional decryption methods rely on the availability of a private key or seed phrase to decrypt encrypted data. However, in the case of lost or stolen devices, these keys or phrases may not be readily available. This poses a significant challenge for recovering access to sensitive information stored on the device.

Proposed Solution
The UCRP protocol addresses this challenge by eliminating the need for the entire decryption key to be present. Instead, the key is split into multiple shares and distributed among trusted parties. These parties could be individuals, organizations, or even smart devices.

When a device is lost or stolen, the owner can contact one of the trusted parties and request decryption assistance. The trusted party provides their share of the decryption key, but not the entire key. This partial decryption key is then combined with partial keys from other trusted parties using secure multi-party computation (MPC).

MPC allows multiple parties to compute a function on their private inputs without revealing the inputs themselves. In the case of UCRP, MPC is used to combine the partial decryption keys to produce the entire decryption key. This entire key is then used to decrypt the encrypted data on the lost or stolen device.

Benefits of UCRP
The UCRP protocol offers several benefits over traditional decryption methods:

Enhanced Security: By not requiring the entire decryption key to be present, UCRP reduces the risk of key compromise and unauthorized access to encrypted data.

Improved Privacy: By distributing the decryption key among multiple parties, UCRP protects user privacy and prevents any single party from gaining access to the entire key.

Increased Accessibility: By eliminating the reliance on private keys or seed phrases, UCRP makes it easier for users to recover access to their lost or stolen devices, even if they have forgotten or lost these keys.

Conclusion
The UCRP protocol is a promising new approach to secure data decryption. It addresses the limitations of traditional decryption methods and offers significant benefits in terms of security, privacy, and accessibility. The protocol is still in its early stages of development, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way we protect and recover sensitive information.
