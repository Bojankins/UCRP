Universal Ciphertext Re-encryption Protocol (UCRP) Technical Report
Introduction
The Universal Ciphertext Re-encryption Protocol (UCRP) is a novel cryptographic protocol designed to securely decrypt encrypted data without revealing the entire decryption key. This protocol offers several advantages over traditional decryption methods, including enhanced security, improved privacy, and increased accessibility.

Background
Traditional decryption methods rely on the availability of a private key or seed phrase to decrypt encrypted data. However, in the case of lost or stolen devices, these keys or phrases may not be readily available. This poses a significant challenge for recovering access to sensitive information stored on the device.

UCRP Protocol Overview
The UCRP protocol addresses this challenge by eliminating the need for the entire decryption key to be present. Instead, the key is split into multiple shares and distributed among trusted parties. These parties could be individuals, organizations, or even smart devices.

When a device is lost or stolen, the owner can contact one of the trusted parties and request decryption assistance. The trusted party provides their share of the decryption key, but not the entire key. This partial decryption key is then combined with partial keys from other trusted parties using secure multi-party computation (MPC).

MPC allows multiple parties to compute a function on their private inputs without revealing the inputs themselves. In the case of UCRP, MPC is used to combine the partial decryption keys to produce the entire decryption key. This entire key is then used to decrypt the encrypted data on the lost or stolen device.

UCRP Protocol Components
The UCRP protocol consists of three main components:

Key Distribution: The decryption key is split into multiple shares and distributed among trusted parties using a secure key distribution mechanism.

Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC): Partial decryption keys from multiple trusted parties are combined using MPC to reconstruct the entire decryption key without revealing the key to any single party.

Homomorphic Decryption: The reconstructed decryption key is used to decrypt the encrypted data on the lost or stolen device using homomorphic encryption techniques.

Benefits of UCRP
The UCRP protocol offers several benefits over traditional decryption methods:

Enhanced Security: By not requiring the entire decryption key to be present, UCRP reduces the risk of key compromise and unauthorized access to encrypted data.

Improved Privacy: By distributing the decryption key among multiple parties, UCRP protects user privacy and prevents any single party from gaining access to the entire key.

Increased Accessibility: By eliminating the reliance on private keys or seed phrases, UCRP makes it easier for users to recover access to their lost or stolen devices, even if they have forgotten or lost these keys.

Applications
The UCRP protocol has a wide range of potential applications, including:

Decrypting lost or stolen devices: UCRP can be used to decrypt the contents of lost or stolen devices without requiring the device owner to possess the private key or seed phrase.

Secure data sharing: UCRP can be used to securely share encrypted data among multiple parties without revealing the decryption key to any single party.

Privacy-preserving data analysis: UCRP can be used to analyze encrypted data without decrypting it first, enabling privacy-preserving data analysis and machine learning.

Conclusion
The Universal Ciphertext Re-encryption Protocol (UCRP) is a promising new approach to secure data decryption. It addresses the limitations of traditional decryption methods and offers significant benefits in terms of security, privacy, and accessibility. The protocol is still in its early stages of development, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way we protect and recover sensitive information.
