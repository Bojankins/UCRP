Universal Ciphertext Re-encryption Protocol (UCRP) Technical Report
Introduction
The Universal Ciphertext Re-encryption Protocol (UCRP) is a novel cryptographic technique that enables secure decryption of encrypted data without revealing the decryption key. This method has the potential to revolutionize data security by addressing the limitations of traditional decryption methods, which often rely on the vulnerability of private keys.

Technical Specifications
Homomorphic Encryption Scheme

The UCRP method utilizes the Paillier homomorphic encryption scheme, which supports addition, multiplication, and comparison operations on encrypted data. This scheme is chosen for its efficiency and security properties.

Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) Protocol

The UCRP method employs the Secure Shuffle and Cut (SSC) MPC protocol, which securely distributes the decryption key among multiple parties. This protocol is chosen for its robustness against malicious parties and its support for efficient key distribution.

Decryption Process

The UCRP decryption process involves the following steps:

Data Encryption: The data to be decrypted is encrypted using the Paillier homomorphic encryption scheme.

MPC Setup: An SSC MPC channel is established among the parties involved in the decryption process.

Key Distribution: The decryption key is securely distributed among the parties using the SSC MPC protocol.

Decryption Computation: Each party performs a portion of the decryption computation using the Paillier homomorphic encryption scheme and their share of the decryption key.

Output Decryption: The results of the decryption computation are combined using the inverse of the Paillier encryption function to obtain the original plaintext data.

Performance Evaluation
Decryption Speed

The UCRP method has been evaluated for decryption speed using various data sizes and key lengths. The results show that the decryption speed is comparable to that of traditional decryption methods, while providing the additional security benefit of not revealing the decryption key.

Security Analysis

The UCRP method has been subjected to rigorous security analysis, demonstrating its resistance to various attacks, including:

Key Exposure: Even if some of the parties involved are compromised, the decryption key remains secure due to its distributed nature.

Ciphertext Attacks: The UCRP method is resilient to known ciphertext attacks, ensuring the confidentiality of encrypted data.

Computation Attacks: The UCRP method protects against malicious parties attempting to infer information about the plaintext data from the MPC computations.

Conclusion
The Universal Ciphertext Re-encryption Protocol (UCRP) presents a significant advancement in cryptographic techniques for secure decryption. Its ability to decrypt data without revealing the decryption key significantly enhances security and privacy in various applications. The protocol's robust security, optimized performance, and compatibility with existing encryption schemes make it a promising tool for safeguarding sensitive information in the digital age.
