# UCRP: User-Controlled Recovery Protocol

UCRP is a novel cryptographic protocol that enables users to recover their lost or compromised data without fully revealing their decryption keys to any single trusted party. This protocol leverages homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation (MPC) to ensure the privacy and security of sensitive user data.

## Key Features

* **User-controlled recovery:** Users maintain control over their decryption keys, allowing them to initiate and manage the recovery process without relinquishing complete control over their data.

* **Privacy-preserving recovery:** The protocol ensures that no single trusted party gains access to the entire decryption key, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive user data.

* **Secure multi-party computation:** MPC techniques are employed to securely combine partial decryption key shares from multiple trusted parties, enabling data decryption without compromising privacy.

## Protocol Overview

The UCRP protocol involves three main steps:

1. **Key distribution:** The user's decryption key is split into multiple shares and distributed among several trusted parties.

2. **Recovery request:** Upon losing access to their decryption key, the user initiates a recovery request with one of the trusted parties.

3. **Secure multi-party computation:** The trusted parties involved in the recovery process collaborate using MPC to combine their partial decryption key shares, enabling the decryption of the user's data.

## Security and Privacy Guarantees

UCRP provides strong security and privacy guarantees, ensuring that:

* **User data remains private:** The protocol prevents any single trusted party from gaining access to the entire decryption key, protecting user data from unauthorized access.

* **Key integrity is preserved:** The key distribution mechanism ensures that the decryption key shares are distributed securely and cannot be easily compromised.

* **Recovery process is secure:** The MPC techniques employed in the recovery process ensure that only authorized trusted parties can contribute to the decryption, preventing unauthorized decryption attempts.

## Applications

UCRP has a wide range of potential applications in scenarios where sensitive data needs to be protected while still allowing for recovery in case of key loss or compromise. These applications include:

* **Cloud storage:** UCRP can be used to enable user-controlled recovery of encrypted data stored in cloud storage services.

* **Device backups:** UCRP can be used to securely back up device data and allow users to recover their data in case of device loss or damage.

* **Password management:** UCRP can be integrated into password management systems to enable user-controlled recovery of master passwords.

## Conclusion

UCRP offers a secure and privacy-preserving solution for user-controlled data recovery. By leveraging homomorphic encryption and MPC, UCRP empowers users to maintain control over their decryption keys while ensuring the protection of their sensitive data. The protocol's versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications where data privacy and recovery are paramount considerations.
